The Basketry Intermediate Representation (IR) defines a structured, machine-oriented format that abstracts over various Interface Definition Languages (IDLs) and Service Description Languages (SDLs). This standardized, language-agnostic schema allows tooling to consistently interpret the core attributes and behaviors of a service, independent of its underlying definition format.\n\nBasketry IR is optimized for automated workflows, enabling code generation, documentation, validation, and custom analysis through reusable components without requiring developers to manually interact with the raw representation. While a typical Basketry pipeline translates human-friendly specifications (such as OpenAPI) into this intermediate format, the IR serves as a foundational layer for building new generators, rules, and other automation tools.",
